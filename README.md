Working with the amazing Lottie library, it was great fun creating an example of a simple [App Introduction](https://github.com/Blakey47/App-Introcution-Story) story. Focusing mainly on my visual design skills, building this rather straight forward app programmatically provided me great insight into a users journey through an intro story via my research to get this just right.

I found the paging controls the greatest challenge in implementing this introduction journey but I was extremely happy with the overall result.
